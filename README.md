## Installation

To get started with this project, you should install it in a virtual environment.

### Follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TP1_IMN708.git
    cd TP1_IMN708
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (or activate it if already created).

3. **Install the library**:
    Once your virtual environment is activated, run the following command to install the project:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
We are actively working on upgrading this project, so please consider pulling the main branch every once in a while ! ðŸ˜ƒ

    ```
show_q_space

- `show_q_space` â€” Display the q-space sampling from a gradient table._(example of g_tab in data_TP3 folder)_
    ```bash
    show_q_space <g_tab>
    ```
## data_TP3

This folder includes some files to test on. Also a preprocess_dmri.sh script is provided.   

# TP2 : Registration

This installation will provide you with access to the following useful commands:

- `compare_pairs` â€” For comparing two 2D images.
    ```bash
    view_image <in_image_1> <in_image_2> [â€”-bins <number of bins>]
    ```
    
- `transform_grid` â€” To apply transformations and visualize grids.
  ```bash

   ```
  
- `register_image` â€” For registering an image to a reference.
    ```bash 
    register_image.py [fix_image Path to fixed image] [transform_method Transformation method: 0=Translation, 1=Rotation, 2=Rigid, 3=Translation-based registration, 4=Rotation-based registration, 5=Rigid registration] [--mov_image Path to moving image] [--p Translation distance along x-axis] [--q Translation distance along y-axis] [--theta Rotation angle in degrees] [--out_dir Directory to save transformed image] [--eta_t Learning rate for translation] [--eta_r Learning rate for rotation] [--n_iter Maximum number of iterations for stopping] [--conv_thresh SSD convergence threshold] [--max_std Maximum standard deviation for SSD] [--n_last Number of last iterations for SSD stability] [--res_level Resolution hierarchy level] [--gauss_sigma Sigma for Gaussian image denoising in multi-resolution method] [--grad_optimizer Gradient descent optimizer for rigid registration: 0=Regular, 1=Momentum-based] [--momentum Momentum factor]
    ```

All commands come with a helpful `--help` parameter, so you can easily learn how to use each one. Just run:

```bash
<command> --help
```
## data_TP2

This folder includes:

- **I and J images** â€” To compare and undertsand similiraty analysis.
- **Brains**  â€” For playing around with image registration and transformation exercises.
- **Affines**  â€” Added to visualize transformations for question 3(c).

## data_TP1

All the data have been converted to NIfTI format for a generalized usage. 

Additionally, Regions of Interest (ROIs) were manually delineated based on the provided data.

The zipped data folder is available within the repository, except for the file `rat111.nii`, which can be downloaded separately from this [link](https://usherbrooke-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nguc4116_usherbrooke_ca/EY_bqpQ-jGBOkGopPhykAiwBptfaZ8PevcJeYeg6sWPqEQ?xsdata=MDV8MDJ8WmluZWIuRWwuWWFtYW5pQFVTaGVyYnJvb2tlLmNhfDc3Mzg0MjA5YWEwNzRjNGIzODZhMDhkY2U2NjkwNzI3fDNhNWE4NzQ0NTkzNTQ1Zjk5NDIzYjMyYzNhNWRlMDgyfDB8MHw2Mzg2Mzg1ODY0ODg5NjE1Njl8VW5rbm93bnxUV0ZwYkdac2IzZDhleUpXSWpvaU1DNHdMakF3TURBaUxDSlFJam9pVjJsdU16SWlMQ0pCVGlJNklrMWhhV3dpTENKWFZDSTZNbjA9fDB8fHw%3d&sdata=ODlDSE5KNGVibDlsU3lBU0Jud0k2VEhVZ3R5YzJzdUU4SzJzYzJKbDNCZz0%3d).
